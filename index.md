The Interbank Card Center ([BKM](https://bkm.com.tr/en)) was established in 1990 with the partnership of 13 public and private Turkish banks for the purpose of providing solutions to the common problems and developing the rules and standards of credit and debit cards in Turkey, within the card payment system.

BKM has sectoral development data with transaction counts and volumes for both credit and debit cards. ([The data can be reached here.](https://bkm.com.tr/en/secilen-aya-ait-sektorel-gelisim/?filter_year=2019&filter_month=6&List=Listele))
